**Pages**: These pages are accessible by administrators for making changes and edits to the application. Broken into 2 folders, one for admin and one for view

**Widgets**: Widgets are modular components that can be reused across different pages. They help in breaking down complex pages into smaller parts.

**Controllers**: Controllers manage the functionality of the application. We have separate controllers for both admin and view pages to handle their respective logic.

**Models**: Models represent the structure of data within the application. They are used to maintain consistency and structure while handling data.

**Services**: Services encapsulate specific functionalities, such as authentication, that can be reused throughout the application.

**UI**: Custom UI components, such as buttons or specialized UI elements, are stored here for consistency and reusability.

**Assets**: All images and static assets are stored in this folder for easy management.
